This year I continued to strive to produce quality work and sought out opportunities that would challenge me and put me in uncomfortable situations. The following five categories list out a series of projects and activities that showcase my growth, adaptability, and impact across the team and organization.

Presentations

1. Appeared in seven monthly outlook presentations where I used a variety of unique visualizations and tried to incorporate storytelling techniques to keep audiences engaged

2. Presented my first in-person presentation at the MF Optigo Seniors Housing Workshop where I received positive feedback from both attendees and Sara Hoffman

3. Continued to present at the quarterly affordable goals meeting

Production of Decks

1. Contributed to and helped produce at least 12 decks for Sam, supporting key initiatives and presentations throughout the year.

2. Integrated Sam’s feedback to develop new approaches for visualizing data and enhancing the narrative he wanted to convey.

3. Ensured each deck was tailored to its specific audience, collaborated with team members to collect and update all charts, and maintained consistency in formatting and style.

Supporting team and Cross-Divisional Collaboration

1. Provided ongoing support to team members by developing custom visualizations and sharing creative approaches to data analysis (e.g., scatterplots, maps).

2. Collaborated with team to develop a metro area exposure to macro risk view where I used Moody’s forecasts to find metros with largest employment risk, pinpointed areas with multiple risks, and used Venn diagram to visualize risk overlaps

3. Delivered key analyses to executives outside the team, including a Bloomberg Financial Conditions Index deep dive for Kevin Cheng and a Housing Risk Dashboard for Anil.
